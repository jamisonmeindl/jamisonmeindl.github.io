I am a First-Year EECS PhD Student at MIT. I have previously completed my B.S. and MEng at MIT. My research focuses on extending the capabilities of large language models, with current applications in black-box optimization and experimental planning. I am advised by [Prof. Wojciech Matusik](https://people.csail.mit.edu/wojciech/) in the [Computational Design and Fabrication Group](https://cdfg.mit.edu) and [Prof. Mina Konaković Luković](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mina/) in the [Algorithmic Design Group](https://adg.csail.mit.edu/).
